- MessageBag: just tell it what to do. PAss it and the others willa dd the message.

- ExpressionTypechecker: The stop one (!innerexpressiontype instanceof booleantype)
Why not introduce an unknown type?
visit(Negation node)  throw new typemismatch
Using exceptions here is abusing them (non-local control flow).

- SYmboltable interface can be deleted (only hashmapymbtoltable to symboltable)
- Make the symboltable more specific in terms of names. (declare, hasDeclared, lookupSymbol)

- QuestioNCollector<T extends Node> can be just Node. No need for the generics.

- StatementVisitor<LIst<Question>> = also no need to make it generic. It just gives back the questions. THe interface implies that there are multiple implementations of different sutff.

THe FormQuestionCollector can be merged with the QuestionVisitor.

- QUestionVisior should be renamed to QuestionCollector.

- get rid of the proxy, just use hte visit name

- TypeChecker visitor (ITypeChecker)

- assoc=left division is currently stronger than *. need to make it equally
