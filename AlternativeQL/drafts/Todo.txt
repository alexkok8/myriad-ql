- defaultvalue  -> rename ->

- assoc=left division is currently stronger than *. need to make it equally

- metadata -> rename to SourceLocation

- AbstractNode doesn't need to use node ()

- Node interface is perhaps not needed (there is no ast node that has as child a node)
(use the abstractnode as a node)

- AntlrVisitor rename to AstBuilder

- Return type from visitForm in the astBuilder (currently visitor) should be Form because it is more specific.

 - Chnge 'abstractode' in the antlrvisitor (astbuilder) to node

 - Regarding the throws 'throwable': SOlution: extend runtimeexception with our own custom exception class. ()

 - Throws is terrible; avoid it.

- AbsractLiteral is not needed (you need to cast it anyway): get rid of it.

- BooleanType equals (as with the other literals) can not done. (Not equals but: compatibility!)

- instance of: flip it around (NumberType is number) innerExpressionType isNUberOf). THe implementation should be in the Type class (override it)

- In ExpressionTypeChecker, the metadata in type checking is not necessary.

- a + b gives currently only one error (because it is throwed like that)

- WHy not use the messagebag also in the expressions type checker?

- MessageBag: just tell it what to do. PAss it and the others willa dd the message.

- ExpressionTypechecker: The stop one (!innerexpressiontype instanceof booleantype)
Why not introduce an unknown type?
visit(Negation node)  throw new typemismatch
Using exceptions here is abusing them (non-local control flow).

- SYmboltable interface can be deleted (only hashmapymbtoltable to symboltable)
- Make the symboltable more specific in terms of names. (declare, hasDeclared, lookupSymbol)

- QuestioNCollector<T extends Node> can be just Node. No need for the generics.

- StatementVisitor<LIst<Question>> = also no need to make it generic. It just gives back the questions. THe interface implies that there are multiple implementations of different sutff.

THe FormQuestionCollector can be merged with the QuestionVisitor.

- QUestionVisior should be renamed to QuestionCollector.

- get rid of the proxy, just use hte visit name

- TypeChecker visitor (ITypeChecker)
