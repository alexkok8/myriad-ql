Review AST code
- Naming conventions (capitalization)

Improve AST
- Think about if we want specified node types for operations instead of the generalized unaryOperation and binaryOperation
- If we keep generalized classes, store operator type as enumeration instead of string

Unit tests
- Add unit tests to validate AST based on input string

Create visitor for AST similar to antlr visitor

Create a design for the complete QL system (e.g wellformedness checker, expression evaluator, renderer, ...)
