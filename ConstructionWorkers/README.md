What parts of the assignment have been completed?
----------

The following parts of the assignment have been completed:

- QL; see the [QL requirements](https://github.com/software-engineering-amsterdam/software-construction/tree/master/2016-2017 "See the QL requirements.") for more details.
- QLS type checker; see the [QLS requirements](https://github.com/software-engineering-amsterdam/software-construction/tree/master/2016-2017 "See the QLS requirements.") for more details. 
A QLS stylesheet is to be supplied when the main program is run, but the stylesheet does not change the appearance of the QL form (i.e., we did not complete the link with the GUI).

The assignment description can be found [here](https://github.com/software-engineering-amsterdam/software-construction/tree/master/2016-2017 "See the assignment description.").

How to run the program?
----------

A QL form and QLS stylesheet are available in <code>./src</code>; <code>form.ql</code> and <code>stylesheet.qls</code>, respectively.
These files are used by the main program, defined in <code>./src/QLMain.java</code>, to visualize the form. 
Want to work with a different form and/or stylesheet? Change the contents of <code>form.ql</code> and/or <code>stylesheet.qls</code>, respectively, or change lines <code>45-46</code> in <code>./src/QLMain.java</code>.
